# Confident Girl - Shy Guy

Prompt: University - Two friends, she’s popular, outgoing, sexy and smart. He’s shy, quiet, reserved, loving and has a secret crush on her. They go to a party together

Another boring Friday night. Thomas sat in his dorm room scowling, unsure what to do with himself. He wanted to go hang out with his floor mates but it gave him toI much anxiety. Drinking helped but he hated losing control of his mind. He needed to be sharp for Saturday, he was running a coding seminar. 

He wasn’t the typical looking nerd with greasy hair and skinny and pale. His friends were, and he liked it. They were themselves. But he took good care of himself dressing well and kept his hair up with whatever trend his sisters said was cool. He felt like he earned his engineering degree when he went mute every time he had to make small talk. 

He heard someone approaching his door, banging and trying the handle “Thomas! Get your butt out here we’re going out!”

It was Avery, she gave him a good feeling from the first day they all moved in.  She was so friendly and genuinely nice to everyone on the floor, she didn’t bother with the cliquey stuff like the other girls. She was usually out though, working through school at a chain restaurant up the street from their residence.

He never saw her on the floor much. He’d text her and she’d tell him about her dates and ex-boyfriend she dumped back home before class started. He kept her up to date on the floor gossip. They weren’t best friends and he wished he could spend more time with her.  He remembered their last study session before midterms. Just sitting beside her in silence was comforting. 

“Thomas don’t pretend you aren’t home I can see your shadow.“

He stood there at the door, frozen. His stomach was jumping all over his insides, he felt terrified. For no reason. Social anxiety. A reason, but not an acceptable one, to him. 

He closed his eyes and opened the door, “you got me.”

“Come, they over-scheduled the restaurant tonight so my boss gave me the night off. Everyone else is out, I tried their doors.”

“Are you going to ask or just boss me around?” He found himself talking to her like he did his family.

“Please, Thomas, would you escort me to this party? I don’t know anyone and but it’s my friend Hannah’s birthday and I promised I’d stop by.“

“It’s gonna cost you.”

“Please, please, please!” She sarcastically begged him. 

She grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the doorway, linking her arm in his. 

“Fine. Bring me beer.”

“Ew you sound like a bro. You don’t even hardly drink.”

“Yeah, but I don’t know what to ask for.“

“How about I’ll owe ya one.”

“Alright. So, how’d you do on that stats midterm? I killed calculus, I got an A. Thanks for studying with me,” he tried to make conversation as they fell into step. 

“Ugh a B plus. Fine, but not good enough. I need to pick it up the rest of the semester. Good job smarty pants!”

They heard the party before they saw it. The house was an old four-square with a sagging porch and twinkle lights. He smelled weed and beer as they walked up. 

“This must be it. Alright, we find the birthday girl, have a shot, and leave,” she spoke to him quietly. 

“Deal. I hate this shit,” he muttered, anxiety ramping up again. 

He had a crush on her but she‘d friend-zoned him. He was “safe” she said, “non-threatening”, “a good friend”. Maybe he used it to be close to her. Maybe she’d actually be more than that some time. Probably not.  

“Hannah! Hey Thomas, this is my friend Hannah from my Art History class. She’s brilliant at memorizing all the dates. Hannah, Thomas,” Avery introduced him to a short, curvy girl with glasses. 

“Happy Birthday, can I buy you a drink?” He joked. 

“Tequila! Here - at the counter,” Hannah lead them to the 

They threw one back and bit their limes. Gross.

Avery and Hannah filled their red party cups with something, he waved a ‘no thanks’.

They stood back, Hannah wandered off and he just stayed there, existing, beside Avery while she sipped and observed. 

“Thomas,” she turned toward him, “who here do you think is cute? You need a girlfriend.”

*You*, he thought, “I dunno,” he looked away.

“Or a boyfriend? I love you either way.”

“No, I’m not looking for anyone. I like women, for the record.”

“Wanna leave?” She asked.

“Sure do,” he didn’t mean to sound grumpy but he knew that he did. 

“Alright let me go say bye,” she left him on the perimeter and disappeared. 

He sat on the crinkly leather couch and started scrolling Reddit. 

She was gone awhile and then there again. She plopped down beside him and pulled his phone out of his hand.

“You’re not going to make friends sitting in the corner on your phone.”

“I don’t want to make friends,” he responded. 

“What about me?” She sounded flirty. 

“Sure, you’re my friend.”

“What if I was more than a friend?”

“You’re drunk.”

“I’m not. I only had that one shot and it was like an hour ago. I’ve been pouring just soda water all night.”

He looked down at his hands in his lap, feeling naked without a phone. 

“Can I kiss you? I mean… not if you don’t want to… we can forget this —“ she sounded less confident than usual. 

“No! No I mean, yes, no don’t forget it…”

She leaned into him, turned her body, reached across and touched his cheek, and pulled his face down to kiss her. 

He didn’t pull back and he didn’t move forward. He was just sort of stunned. He let her kiss him. She moved closer and swung her leg over him, now she was in his lap straddling him.

“It’s just me,” she whispered into his ear. Then she licked the edge of his ear, flicking at it and biting his earlobe with her lips. He shuddered and felt himself getting hard against her. She’d definitely feel it. One hand behind her head and one of her back he pulled her in and started kissing her harder. She wasn’t lying, she tasted like chemically-flavoured green lime Bubbly, not alcohol. 

He disappeared into her. The room, the noise, the smells didn’t matter anymore. He put his hand under her shirt and felt her skin. She was so smooth and soft. She was grinding into him, he felt like he was high. 

“Get a room you two,” someone yelled and threw a pillow at Avery’s head. 

“I think I will!” She stood up and lead him past the kitchen up the creaky stairs. At the landing there was ladder, she walked forward and started climbing. 

“Where are you going? I’m not making out with you in some creepy attic,” he said. 

She disappeared up at the top, he heard a click and a soft glow lit up the entrance. He climbed up after her. It was a carpeted loft with a short ceiling and pillows and Christmas lights. Avery lay on a mattress on the floor. He couldn’t stand up all the way so he crawled over to her, laying over her and leaned down to keep kissing her. Their legs intertwined and she was breathing heavy. He made sure he kept all his weight on one arm, he didn’t want to squish her, and explored her with his other hand. 

She was wearing a low cut shirt. He pulled it down on one side, exposed her bra, pulled that down and fingered her nipple. It was hard.  She moaned and arched her hips up into him. She was full on grinding into him, her legs wrapped tight. He didn’t want to screw it up but he wasn’t nervous any more. He lifted his head up, “can I take it off,” pulling up at the bottom of her shirt. 

“Yes,” she lifted her arms and helped him. She was wearing a smooth deep blue bra with lace on the edges. It fit her well. Her breasts were small but full. 

He reached to unclip her bra. He fumbled for a minute, “need help?” She asked, kindly, she wasn’t making fun. 

He kept playing with the clasp, “nope,” and leaned in to kiss her some more. He was straddling her now, she felt small beneath him. Her skin glowed, golden and warm under the coloured lights. He sat back on his knees, “Jesus, Avery.”

“What?” She looked up at him concerned for a minute, and reached up to cover herself. 

“You’re gorgeous. God, I can’t believe this is happening,” he said and leaned back down to lick her nipples, one side then the other. She seemed to like it, he felt it in her breathing, she was moaning and squirming. He sucked one and twisted the other gently, feeling her. 

“Fuck baby, don’t stop whatever you’re doing,” she sighed. 

He sat back on his knees again and pulled his shirt off. He rain his hand over her collar bone, her breast, down her stomach, made a circle with his finger and stopped at the top of her jeans. 

 She reached down and undid the button, wiggling her way out of her pants. She put here legs straight up in the air in front of his face, caught in her jeans, “help?” She asked. 

He pulled them off. Her underwear matched her bra. He cupped her pubic mound, holding her and laid down beside her propped up on one arm. 

“You’re wet,” he said. 

“Mmhmm. I want you,” pressed into his hand. 

“I don’t have a condom. I might have one in my wallet but it’s so old I don’t trust it.”

“Try in there,” she pointed to a set of drawers in the corner, “top drawer.”

“Have you done this before? Am I in your regular hook up spot?” He couldn’t decide if he cared. 

“If a girl has condoms they’re going to be beside the bed, right?” She didn’t give him a straight answer but he let it go. 

He crawled over, there was a dildo, one of those wand vibrators and a box of red Lifestyles condoms. He felt embarrassed, this was private. He grabbed the box and slammed the drawer. 

“Babe, we’re all adults. What are you afraid of?”

“I want you,” he said, “but not yet.”

“Yeah you still have your pants on. Off,” she tugged at them. He was wearing sweatpants, she pulled them right down and grabbed him. She stroked him through his boxers.

“You lay down now,” she pushed him onto the mattress, climbed on top of his legs and ran her fingers under the waistband, pulling off his boxers and exposing him. 

His dick stood straight up, he was rock hard.

“Thomas, that is a beautiful cock,” she said before she leaned forward and put her mouth on him. 

He closed his eyes, desire for her pumped through him, he was not going to cum but he probably could in seconds. She stroked him and started sucking him. 

She pulled back, spit in her hand, and sucked him back into her mouth, twisting and stroking.

“Shit, stop Avery, or else I’m gonna finish,” he gasped. 

“Do you want to?” She asked.

“Not yet, I want you,” he replied. 

She lay down in between his arm and body, naked except for her panties. He was naked on someone’s bed on the floor and there wasn’t even a door. It should bother him more than it did. 

He rolled on to his side, facing her, kissing her and feeling for her pussy. He put his hand under the lace, felt her lips. She was so warm and wet. He rubbed back and forth between her pussy lips to find her clit. She moaned and kissed him hard. She put her hand over his and pushed his fingers lower, into her. He slid his fingers in and out with her help, then she let him take over. 

“Ohmigod Thomas,” she was breathing hard, grabbing him and matching his rhythm with her hips. She arched and he went deeper. He wanted to taste her, he wanted to feel what it was like to make her cum. He worked his fingers in and out some more and moved his body so he was over her. Her teased her pussy with his cock, rubbing it over her, poking at her pussy lips. She wrapped her arms around his back and tried to pull him down, into her. He resisted. He pulled off her underwear and spread her legs. 

“Not yet,” he felt powerful now, in control. She wanted him. He wanted her too, but she really wanted him. He’d make her cum and make her want him again and again. 

He moved down between her legs, she spread them and tilted her hips up. He licked slowly inside her thigh. Then on the other side. Nowhere near her pussy. He felt her energy buzzing under him. He kissed her pussy lips. He tongued her clit like he was making out with her. He reached up and pinched her nipples, then flicked her clit and she moaned. 

“Mmm, don’t stop,” she breathed heavy. She ran her hands over his head through his hair, pushing him down. With one hand he pulled her lips apart and exposed her clit, with the other he held her breast and mimicked the motion on her nipple with his fingers. 

“Holy shit,” she grabbed his head. He took that as a signal she was getting closer. He pressed harder with his tongue, circling, flicking, playing with her clit between his lips. He nibbled with his lips like he was biting her without teeth. 

“Fuck, I’m so close,” she shoved her pussy up to his mouth. 

He found a steady rhythm and licked up and down. She humped his face and thrashed her head around. 

“Yes, yes, yes, fuck, I’m cumming,” she moaned under him. She pushed his head away and moved up on the bed. 

Pride filled his belly, he crawled up and kissed her. She tasted herself on him, wiped his mouth with her hand, and kept kissing him. He felt her wrap her legs and pull him down, trying to manoeuvre him into her.

“Hey, hey. A man needs protection.”

He sat back, rolled the condom on and planked over her. She reached down and grabbed his cock, lining him up. He held back. 

“I want to feel you in me,” she said.

He thrust into her. Electricity flooded his body. He thrust again and again, she opened up to him. Animalistic energy took over him and he fucked her hard. She dug her nails into his back. 

“Flip over,” he told her, he pulled back and let her readjust. She got on all fours and eased her ass back towards him. He leaned forward filling her with his cock. He grabbed her hips and felt her pussy envelop him, in and out, all the way, slowly, in and out. There wasn’t much friction, she was soaked. He felt her hand down between their legs, she started playing with herself. 

“Keep going, fuck me hard,” she said. 

He sped up, strong thrusts, but he couldn’t find a rhythm. She rubbed herself frantically, “harder!” So he slammed her harder. 

“Fuck Avery,” he was on the edge, she was moaning under him and she took it all. A few more strokes and he’d be done, his cock twitching inside her. 

“Yes baby, yes, yes, yes,” she moaned, he fucked her, he felt like he was falling and he exploded, cumming hard. He heard himself grunt when he finished, eyes closed, fireworks in his head. 

“Holy shit Thomas, I didn’t know you had that in you,” she said as he pulled out. He held the edge of the condom so it didn’t slip off. He looked around for a tissue, found one on the side table and folded the used goods neatly into it. 

Then he laid down beside her, she put her head on his shoulder. Her hair was in his face, he waved it away. 

She smoothed her hair down, mumbled “sorry,” and put her leg over his. Her fingers were fluttering over his chest, playing with his chest hair. He felt her wet still, on his thigh, as they lay there. 

“Did you cum again?” he asked, not really concerned just curious. 

“No, I was so close but then you finished, it’s ok,” she said. 

“I’ll finish you.”

“No really it’s okay,” she said. 

“No I want to. Please. Let me,” he crawled down between her legs again, hooked an arm under each thigh and kissed her. She tasted like latex and pussy. He started licking, she responded by pushing herself up into him, so he pulled his hand out from under her to finger her. He licked her clit gently and slid his fingers in. She was wet and stretched out, he could reach in deep. He found a smooth spot reaching up towards her belly button and stroked it. 

“Right there! Yes,” she spread her legs as far as she could, he licked and fingered her, she wasn’t far off. He felt her pussy tighten around his fingers and pressed harder. 

“I’m gonna cum again,” She was moaning and writhing beneath him, then was completely still, braced, “fuuuccckkkk,” he felt her pussy squeeze on his fingers, and she pushed his head off her again. 

He lay down beside her, holding her, she curled up in the fetal position.

“How you doing?” He asked.

“Fuck Thomas, that was fun,” she whispered and wiggled back closer to him. 

He lay there holding her, soaking it up. He was  drained.
