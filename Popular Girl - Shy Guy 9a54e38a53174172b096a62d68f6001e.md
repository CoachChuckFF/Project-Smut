# Popular Girl - Shy Guy

Prompt: University - Two friends, she’s popular, outgoing, sexy and smart. He’s shy, quiet, reserved, loving and has a secret crush on her. They go to a party together

Another boring Friday night. Thomas sat in his dorm room scowling, unsure what to do with himself. He wanted to go hang out with his floor mates but it gave him to much anxiety. Drinking helped but he hated losing control of his mind. He needed to be sharp for Saturday, he was running a coding seminar. 

He wasn’t the typical looking nerd with great hair and skinny and pale. His friends were, and he liked it. But he took good care of himself dressing well and kept his hair up with whatever trends his sisters said was cool. He felt like he earned his engineering degree when he went mute every time he had to make small talk. 

He heard someone approaching his door, banging and trying the handle “Thomas! Get your butt out here we’re going out!”

It was Avery, she gave him a good feeling from the first day they all moved in.  She was so friendly and genuinely nice to everyone on the floor, she didn’t bother with the cliquey stuff like the other girls. She was usually out though working through school at a chain restaurant up the street from their residence.

He never saw her on the floor much. He’d text her and tell him about her dates and ex-boyfriend she dumped back home before class started. He kept her up to date on the floor gossip. They weren’t best friends and he wished he could spend more time with her.  He remembered their last study session before midterms. Just sitting beside her in silence was comforting. 

“Thomas don’t pretend you aren’t home I can see your shadow.“

He stood there at the door, frozen. His stomach was jumping all over his insides, he felt terrified. For no reason. Social anxiety. A reason, but not an acceptable one, to him. 

He closed his eyes and opened the door, “you got me.”

“Come, they over-scheduled the restaurant tonight so my boss gave me the night off. Everyone else is out, I tried their doors.”

“Are you going to ask or just boss me around?” He found himself talking to her like he did his family.

“Please Thomas would you escort me to this party? I don’t know anyone and but it’s my friend Hannah’s birthday and I promised I’d stop by.“

“It’s gonna cost you.”

“Please, please, please!” She sarcastically begged him. 

She grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the doorway, linking her arm in his. 

“Fine. Bring me beer.”

“Ew you sound like a bro. You don’t even hardly drink.”

“Yeah, but I don’t know what to ask for.“

“How about I’ll owe ya one.”

“Alright. So, how’d you do on that stats midterm? I killed calculus, I got an A. Thanks for studying with me,” he tried to make conversation as they fell into step. 

“Ugh a B plus. Fine, but not good enough. I need to pick it up the rest of the semester. Good job smarty pants!”

They heard the party before they saw it, an old four-square with a sagging porch and twinkle lights. He smelled weed and beer as they walked up. 

“This must be it. Alright, we find the birthday girl, have a shot, and leave,” she spoke to him quietly. 

“Deal. I hate this shit,” he muttered, anxiety ramping up again. 

He had a crush on her but she‘d friend-zoned him. He was “safe” she said, “non-threatening”, “a good friend”. Maybe he used it to be close to her. Maybe she’d actually be more than that some time. Probably not.  

“Hannah! Hey Thomas, this is my friend Hannah from my Art History class. She’s brilliant at memorizing all the dates. Hannah, Thomas,” Avery introduced him to a short, curvy girl with glasses. 

“Happy Birthday, can I buy you a drink?” He joked. 

“Tequila! Here - at the counter,” Hannah lead them to the 

They threw one back and but their limes. Gross.

Avery and Hannah filled their red party cups with something, he waved a ‘no thanks’.

They stood back, Hannah wandered off and he just stayed there, existing beside Avery while she sipped and observed. 

“Thomas,” she turned toward him, who here do you think is cute? You need a girlfriend.”

*You*, he thought, “I dunno,” he looked away.

“Or a boyfriend? I love you either way.”

“No, I’m not looking for anyone. I like women, for the record.”

“Wanna go?” She asked.

“Sure do,” he didn’t mean to sound grumpy but he knew that he did. 

“Alright let me go say bye,” she left him on the perimeter and disappeared. 

He sat on the crinkly leather couch and started scrolling Reddit. 

She plopped down beside him and pulled his phone out of his hand.

“You’re not going to make friends sitting in the corner on your phone.”

“I don’t want to make friends,” he responded. 

“What about me?” She sounded flirty. 

“Sure, you’re my friend.”

“What if I was more than a friend?”

“You’re drunk.”

“I’m not. I just had that one shot and it was like an hour ago. I’ve been pouring just soda water all night.”

He looked down at his hands in his lap, feeling naked without a phone. 

“Can I kiss you? I mean… not if you don’t want to… we can forget this —“

“No! No I mean, yes, no don’t forget it…”

She leaned into him, turned her body, reached across and touched his cheek, and pulled his face down to kiss her. 

He didn’t pull back and he didn’t move forward. He was just sort of stunned. He let him kiss her. She moved closer and swung her leg over him, now she was in his lap straddling him.

“It’s just me,” she whispered into his ear. Then she licked the edge of his ear, flicking at it and biting his earlobe with her lips. He shuddered and felt himself getting hard against her. She’d definitely feel it. One hand behind her head and one of her back he pulled her in and started kissing her harder. She wasn’t lying, she tasted like chemically-flavoured lime green Bubbly.
